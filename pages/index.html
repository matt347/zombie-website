                <em>Friend No More</em> is a strategic multiplayer zombie survival game where the player begins human.
                As zombie waves progress, the zombies become more and more mutated.
                No zombie is alike.
                Zombies will become bigger and stronger and posess unknown and unique abilities through mutation.
                Players must adapt to the ever changing environment while they fight for survival.
                To surivive, the players must allow the zombies to mutate them.
                The player must get bitten to even out the playing field.
                The more bites however, the more zombie like the player becomes.
                The player must balance their humanity with their need to survive.
                If the player succumbs to too many bites, they will join the horde of zombies as whatever genetic-freak-mutation they've become
                and begin taking down the remaining humans and mutants alike.
                The game only allows one person to win, so it is a last man standing scenario where the last man standing isn't necessarily human.
                <em>Friend No More</em> is meant to be a devious spin on an otherwise classic zombie genre.
