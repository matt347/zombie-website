                    Working on a crazy, over the top project like this has been a goal of mine for a while.
                    I have all these ideas that I finally get to put down somewhere.
                    There are so many things I wish I could have done in other games that I get to do here as much as I want.
                    Best of all, I get to choose how everything is done.
                    I like having total creative freedom.
                    Yeah there is definetly a chance that freedom ends up biting me in the butt.
                    But hey, at least I tried.

                    Ideally, everyone, I'll admit though, it's probably not.
                    It can definitely be a little much and is very rough around the edges.
                    If you have trouble with horror, zombies, blood, or guns, then you're probably out of luck.
                    Maybe PBS kids can help you out.

                <p style="font-size: 23px">
                    I have a lot of plans for this game. There are a lot of features that I haven't even touched upon.
                    A lot of mechanics are still in the works. Hopefully I can get a demo out in the sort of near future.
                    I need to add more zombies, weapons, guns, and pretty much everything else.
                    Things are chugging along though and hopefully by 2090 I have my first pre pre pre pre alpha demo.

 <!-- Working on a project like this has been my goal of mine for a while. Personally, I am intrigued by story-driven narratives.<br>

                 imagination to go beyond what has been done before with the drive to get it done. This game captures many aspects that <br>
                 I love most about games. It's chaotic. It's unpredictable. It's action packed to the brim. While there will not be much of a story<br>
